IIFE

Takes advantage of how local variables work, executes them right away.

Difference between Object.keys() and for in

The Object.keys() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable
properties, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop
(the difference being that a for-in loop enumerates properties in the prototype
chain as well).

Explicit binding

- Bind returns a new copy of a function
- Does not call any function
- Allows you to modify a function without affecting original one

Constructor

- convention is to capitalize first word
- lets people know you're making an object not a function

When calling a constructor, be sure to use 'new', otherwise shit gets messy

Callback is a function you write but someone else invokes

When you throw an exception, it interrupts all the function calls
